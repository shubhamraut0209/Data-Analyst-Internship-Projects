# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Objective
Analyze global COVID-19 data to uncover infection trends, regional impacts, and key factors influencing case severity and recovery.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Datasets Used**:
  - `day_wise.csv`: Daily confirmed, deaths, recovered cases.
  - `country_wise_latest.csv`: Latest country-wise case statistics.
  - `worldometer_data.csv`: Country-level demographics and testing metrics.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Import and clean COVID-19 datasets.
- Track daily infection and recovery trends.
- Identify regional hot zones and patterns.
- Perform feature correlation analysis.
- Visualize results using line charts, heatmaps, scatter plots.

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing values and standardized column formats.
- Converted date columns for time-series plotting.
- Merged relevant fields across datasets for cross-analysis.

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- **Line charts**: Daily confirmed vs. recovered trends.
- **Heatmaps**: Correlations between key features like population density, testing rate, and total deaths.
- **Bar/Scatter Plots**: Country-wise case distribution and factor comparison.

---

## 🔎 Key Findings

- Strong correlation between testing rate and reported case numbers.
- Population density and active case load heavily influence death rates.
- Some countries report high cases with surprisingly low deaths, possibly due to healthcare strength or underreporting.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- Boost testing in low-reporting countries.
- Focus public health strategy on densely populated areas.
- Use time-series data to build predictive pandemic alert systems.
